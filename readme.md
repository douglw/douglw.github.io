This is just a note to self so don't bother reading it, you could but I wouldn't suggest it. Not for NSFW reasons, it's just a bunch of boring and useless stuff that you (as the viewer) would fine practically useless in your time here.

creatives will have a bunch of other stuff in it, probably like subsections for drawings, coding-related shit, and other stuff that I might just consider "creative".
fill a little bit more space in the index file, it feels too, empty.
